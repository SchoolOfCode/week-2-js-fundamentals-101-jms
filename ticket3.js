  single purchases over Â£20.

MVP3  
BookNook need to make more money, so the discounts function needs to change.
 applyDiscount should now only apply the discount to the overspend above Â£20.
  Remember: Agile is all about embracing change ðŸ˜…

Create a variable called overspend, this variable will store the overspent value over 20.
Once we have the overspend we apply a 10% to it
Substract the discounted overspend from the total price
